#
# Wrapper to delegate to configuration to the 
# appropriate `configure` strategy based on the active platform.
#
# Today, OCaml has separate build strategies:
# - Linux, OSX, Cygwin (gcc) - https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/trunk/INSTALL.adoc
# - Windows, Cygin (mingw) - https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/trunk/README.win32.adoc
#
# We want `esy` to work cross-platform, so this is a shim script that will delegate to the
# appropriate script depending on the platform. We assume that if the platform is `CYGWIN`
# that the `mingw` (native executable) strategy is desired.
